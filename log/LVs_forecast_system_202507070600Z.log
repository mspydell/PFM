initializing model and making the info.pkl file.
first, we need all the model information.
from /home/mspydell/models/PFM_root/PFM/sdpm_py_util/pfm_input_v2p0.py
we create a dictionary of model info
forecast
the model_info dictionary is saved to /scratch/matt/PFM_Simulations_v2/forecast_info.pkl
this file dictates how the model is run, where files are saved, etc.

starting forecast with subprocess...
we are going to start clean...
getting PFM info...
cleaning out directories...
now making a new PFM.pkl file.

Going to do a PFM forecast from
2025-07-07 12:00:00
to
2025-07-12 12:00:00


getting the hycom forecast time...
this will clean, download new hycom files, then find the forecast date covering the PFM times.
we currently have hycom forecasts starting from:
['2025-07-05', '2025-07-06']
checking to see if we are missing any files...
we are missing 187 files from these forecasts.
attempting to get these files ...
getting <=10 hycom files...
